> Stop your coding agents from writing conflicting code.

Overlap is a **JSONL tracer + self-hosted dashboard** that prevents coding agents from stepping on each other. It detects when two agents are about to edit the same code, blocks conflicts before they ship, and gives your team real-time visibility into agent activity.

## Features

- **Conflict Prevention** - Automatically blocks agents from editing code a teammate's agent is already working on
- **Real-Time Coordination** - Detects collisions at the file, function, and line level before they become merge conflicts
- **Smart Overlap Detection** - Line-level and function-level matching catches conflicts early
- **Full History Backfill** - Sync all your historical sessions on first join
- **LLM-Powered Summaries** - AI summarizes what you're doing (BYOK)
- **Personal History** - Searchable timeline of all your sessions
- **Self-Hosted & Private** - All session data stays on your infrastructure; anonymous telemetry pings overlap.dev for version checks
- **Zero Platform Cost** - Deploy to Cloudflare free tier

## How It Works

```

The **tracer binary** runs on your machine and parses Claude Code's local JSONL session logs, then syncs them to your self-hosted Overlap instance.

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy the Dashboard

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/overlapcode/overlap)

Click to deploy Overlap to your Cloudflare account. The D1 database will be created automatically.

After deployment:
1. Visit your URL and go to `/setup`
2. Create your team (set name and dashboard password)
3. Add repositories to track in Settings → Repos

### 2. Install the Tracer

```bash
# macOS
brew install overlapdev/tap/overlap

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://overlap.dev/install.sh | sh
```

### 3. Join Your Team

```bash
# Join and backfill your full history
overlap join https://your-team.pages.dev

# Start the background sync daemon
overlap start
```

The tracer will:
- Prompt you for your user token (from `/join` page)
- Backfill all historical sessions for registered repos
- Watch for new sessions and sync them in real-time

### 4. Invite Team Members

Share your Overlap URL with team members. They can:
1. Visit `/join` and enter the team join code
2. Get their user token
3. Install the tracer and run `overlap join <url>`

## Tracer Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `overlap join <url>` | Join a team and backfill history |
| `overlap start` | Start background sync daemon |
| `overlap stop` | Stop the daemon |
| `overlap status` | Show sync status |
| `overlap sync` | Manual sync trigger |
| `overlap config` | View/edit configuration |

## Manual Deploy

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/overlapcode/overlap
cd overlap
npm install

# Build and deploy
npm run build
wrangler deploy

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate:remote
```

## LLM Providers

Configure an LLM provider for better activity summaries:

| Provider | Models | Cost |
|----------|--------|------|
| Heuristic | Path-based | Free |
| Anthropic | Claude Haiku 3.5, Sonnet 4 | $-$$ |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini | $-$$ |
| Google | Gemini 2.0 Flash | $ |
| xAI | Grok 2 | $$ |

Configure in Dashboard → Settings → LLM.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Run migrations locally
npm run db:migrate:local

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Build
npm run build
```
